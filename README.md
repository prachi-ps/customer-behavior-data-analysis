# Customer Behavior Data Analysis
A data analytics project focused on understanding customer purchasing patterns, revenue behavior, product performance, and review insights. The project follows a complete end-to-end workflow: data loading in Python, exploratory analysis and cleaning, SQL queries for business questions, and finally a Power BI dashboard for interactive reporting.

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes a Customer Behavior Dataset to extract meaningful insights about sales, revenue, customer demographics, product performance, and spending patterns.
It showcases an end-to-end analytics pipeline:
1. Load & explore dataset in Python (Jupyter Notebook)
2. Perform EDA and data cleaning
3. Store cleaned data in MySQL database
4. Run analytical SQL queries
5. Build a Power BI Dashboard for visualization

This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, database analytics, and BI reporting.
